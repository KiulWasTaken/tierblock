# Bug fixes:

  - When unlocking level 4, the level-up reward gives the user a dark oak log instead of a sapling; I made a typo.
  - Sugar canes now only gives xp per block broken, because bad.
  - Sugar canes, melons, and pumpkins now flag whether they were player-player or not (To prevent massive free xp doo doo).
  - Sub-skill stats may display N/A, due to it dividing by zero sometimes.
  - Global level-ups are now displayed for every island team member, instead of only the member who cause the level-up.
  - Beehives now give the same boost time for each island member, instead of the time varying for each one.
  - Fishing sometimes just ignores everything and doesn't work.
  - Some mining goals in stats menu varied from the actual goal.
